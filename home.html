									<li><h1>History of Rocket League</h1>
						  			<p>Rocket League is a game released by Psyonix in July 2015. Rocket League really began in 2008 through its predecessor Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars (SARPBC). It was playable on PlayStation 3. It wasn't able to gain much traction due to its complexity and its lack of marketing. But the developers realised they had something unique and made a lot of improvements and design fixes. The knew game realised quickly gained a lot of popularity. The premise of the game is, two teams of rocket-powered cars compete to score goals in a giant soccer-like arena. The high skill ceiling and high number of mechanics mean that there is a lot of improvements that a player can make. The game is always changing, finding new mechanics and better ways to play means that game is constantly evolving, players getting better and better.
